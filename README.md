# Maya's Worlds
## _multi page website inspired by my little sisters artwork_
##
Mayas Worlds is a website with two subpages (third yet to come) I created in vanilla Javascript as my first real-life project. Inspired by my 7-years-old sister Majas drawings, I turned them into animated svgs and created simple mini-games (funny cats quiz and destroying the covid) as a tribute to children's imagination. So be prepared for silly names, ridiculous quotes (all unfortunatelly only in polish).
